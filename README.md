# angular2_rc5_quickstart

__IMPORTANT NOTE:__
There is now a CLI that uses webpack and installs rc.5, making this repo unnecessary. See a good write-up on installing and using [here](https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/blog/2016/08/24/angular-2-cli-bootstrap-your-angular-2-app-in-a-breeze/). You'll need Node 6.5.0 installed or you'll get console errors galore (as of this writing the CLI docs incorrectly state Node 4 or greater). Also, if you install the CLI globally under another version of Node and then switch to 6.5.0 you'll need to install it again under 6.5.0.
