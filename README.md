# angular2_rc5_quickstart
Angular CLI starter project updated to rc.5. Current `ng new` installs rc.4, which is pre-`ngModule`. This is just a stop-gap starter until the CLI is updated or gets a flag to install with rc.5 (or obviously until Angular 2 is released). The primary changes are outlined [here in the official Angular docs](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/rc4-to-rc5.html).

## Install
`npm install` (Mac requires `sudo npm install`).

## Run
`npm start` or `ng serve`
